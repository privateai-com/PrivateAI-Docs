# FSN Nodes

FSN nodes are decentralized storage providers within the PrivateAI ecosystem. They ensure secure and efficient data storage, enhancing the platform's robustness and scalability.

**How FSN nodes work:**

1.  Data upload:

    Data creators upload encrypted data to FSN nodes.
2.  Data storage:

    Encrypted data is distributed across multiple nodes for redundancy and high availability.
3.  Data retrieval:

    When requested, data is securely retrieved, decrypted, and delivered to authorized clients.

**Role of FSN nodes:**

1.  Decentralized storage:

    Eliminates single points of failure, ensuring data availability and quick access.
2.  Data Security:

    Uses Fully homomorphic encryption to keep data secure and private.
3.  Scalability:

    Easily accommodates growth by adding new nodes as needed.
4.  Data integrity:

    Maintains data integrity through replication across multiple nodes, protecting against data loss or corruption.

**FSN Node providers**

Node providers offer storage capacity and ensure the smooth functioning of the decentralized storage network.

* Provision of storage:\
  FSN node providers offer their storage resources to the network, ensuring ample capacity for data storage needs.
* Stake PGPT tokens:\
  To become an FSN node provider, they stake PGPT tokens as collateral, ensuring their commitment to the network.
* Earnings:\
  They earn rewards in PGPT tokens for providing storage services. These rewards are distributed regularly, even with compensation during periods of low client demand to maintain their engagement.
* Data management:\
  FSN node providers manage the storage and retrieval of encrypted data, ensuring its availability and integrity.
