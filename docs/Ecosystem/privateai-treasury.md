# PrivateAI treasury

The PGPT Treasury within PrivateAI functions as a central hub for collecting fees generated from the platform's analytical services. These fees, paid in PGPT tokens by clients subscribing to AI models, are redistributed to FSN and PSN node providers during periods of low client activity. This redistribution ensures that node providers receive ongoing financial support, thereby maintaining their participation and operational capacity within the ecosystem.
