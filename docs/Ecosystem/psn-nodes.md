# PSN Nodes

PSN nodes are decentralized data processing units within the PrivateAI ecosystem. They handle data analytics, computation, and processing tasks, ensuring efficient and secure data handling.

**How PSN nodes work**

1.  Data processing:

    PSN nodes perform computations on encrypted data using Fully homomorphic encryption, allowing processing without decrypting the data.
2.  AI model training:

    Data uploaded by creators is used by PSN nodes to train AI models, ensuring high-quality analytics and insights.
3.  Task distribution:

    Processing tasks are distributed across multiple PSN nodes, enhancing speed of the system.

**Role of PSN nodes in PrivateAI**

1.  Decentralized processing:

    Distributes computational tasks across the network, avoiding single points of failure and enhancing processing speed.
2.  Data security:

    Uses FHE to ensure that data remains encrypted during processing, safeguarding user privacy.
3.  AI model improvement:

    Continuously improves AI models by processing new data, providing users with more accurate and insightful analytics.
4.  Scalability:

    Scales by adding new nodes to handle increased data processing demands.

**PSN Node providers**

PSN node providers are essential participants in the PrivateAI ecosystem. They supply processing power and ensure the efficient functioning of the decentralized processing network.

* Provision of processing power:\
  PSN node providers offer their computational resources to the network, ensuring sufficient capacity for data processing needs.
* Stake PGPT tokens:\
  To become a PSN node provider, they stake PGPT tokens as collateral, demonstrating their commitment to the network.
* Earnings:\
  They earn rewards in PGPT tokens for providing processing services. These rewards are distributed regularly, even with compensation during periods of low client demand to maintain their engagement.
* Data management:\
  PSN node providers manage the processing of encrypted data, ensuring it remains secure and efficiently handled.
