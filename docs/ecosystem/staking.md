# Staking

The yield for staking $PGPT tokens on PrivateAI.com may vary based on various factors, including the staking period and overall participation. Users can receive varying levels of rewards depending on their contribution.

The APY calculation for each staker is influenced by several factors, including the number of tokens staked, the number of users participating in staking, and the total reward pool available. Here’s how it works:

- Number of Staked Tokens: Staking contributes to the security and efficiency of the PrivateAI network. Users who stake tokens support network operations and, in return, receive rewards based on network performance and overall contributions. The staking system proportionally distributes rewards based on the amount staked.
- Total Reward Pool: The total reward pool for PGPT staking is capped at 5,000,000 PGPT. This pool is distributed among all stakers according to their staked amount and the staking period selected (see the staking periods above).
- Staking Period: Longer staking periods yield higher APY rates. For instance, staking for 12 months offers a significantly higher APY compared to staking for just 3 months, reflecting the increased commitment and risk.
