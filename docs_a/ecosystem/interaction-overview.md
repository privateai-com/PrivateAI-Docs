**Data management**

**Data сreation and integration:** Data creators permit AI analytics to utilize their data for training models, contributing to the enhancement of the AI’s accuracy and reliability. This data is integrated into the platform’s graph, enriching the overall knowledge base.

**Node infrastructure**

**FSN and DAO PSN nodes:** The platform’s infrastructure includes FSN nodes, responsible for data storage, and DAO PSN nodes, which handle data processing. These nodes are important for maintaining the platform’s decentralized and robust architecture.

**DAO interface**

The Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) interface manages the interaction between nodes, data creators, and clients.&#x20;

#### Treasury

PGPT Treasury oversees the distribution of rewards and earnings, ensuring a fair and transparent financial system. It also sends rewards to node providers when client demand is low, ensuring continued participation and resource availability.

**Staking protocol**

**Data requests and payments:** Clients request data by making payments in PGPT tokens. These transactions ensure that data creators and node owners are compensated fairly for their contributions.
